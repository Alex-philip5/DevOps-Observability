## EC2 Instance Provisioning

1. Navigate to the `environment/dev/ec2` folder:

```bash
cd environment/dev/ec2
```

2. Open the `ec2.tfvars` file and modify it with your desired details. This file contains variables used in the Terraform configuration.

### Deployment

1. Initialize Terraform in the working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Create an execution plan:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

3. Apply the changes to create the EC2 instance:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

4. To destroy the EC2 instance and associated resources:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

**Note**: Always review the execution plan (`terraform plan`) before applying changes to avoid unintended modifications.
